One of intelligence's functions is arguably problem solving. On human terms we would already consider solving a single problem as requiring intelligence.\\nOne may argue that Evolution is also set out to solve a problem (indeed, one that would not exist if Evolution wouldn't exist - a paradox with which we are well aquainted in modern product development).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What is Evolution's problem then? I'd argue for \\\"survival\\\" since Evolution's intention seems to be to keep life alive. If you think that I am anthropomorphizing evolution consider that I am looking at intelligence at an abstract level. One may consider that the mechanisms of intelligence should not be regarded as human features a priori. Other aspects of nature may exert similar functions and behaviours that, on an abstract level, may be judged as intelligence.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What about intelligence's ways to implement its goal? One way of humans to solve problems is via trial and error. Indeed this is the most recognized mechanism of evolution as well. Selective mutation essentially performs variations on its designs and survival performs a beautiful feedback loop in that successful variations will have a greater chance to multiply.\\nHumans design procedures also quite often go through trial and error - and failure, of which there are enough examples in human designs as well as evolved species (just look for the extinct ones). This mechanism forms a great, if not the major part of our everyday problem solving, for much of our abilities on finding good designs is based on the evolutionary improvement of tools that we can use to perform trial and errors at great speed e.g. in simulations or in programming languages that encapsulate problem layouts in a few lines of text.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The ability to memorize successful designs is also something that we share with Evolution.
