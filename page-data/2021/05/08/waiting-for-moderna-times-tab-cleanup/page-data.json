The things I've learned through following posts and tweets from experts in the fields of Immunology and Virology, Vaccines, DNA, RNA, and mRNA have left me in awe at the wonderful machinery of life, a machinaery that begins in brownian motion and molecular mechanical devices and ends in human minds designing mRNA to combat a new pathogen. Fantastic! We need to touch the emotions of kids when we introduce such things in school - facts are fantastic, but they must be connected to our emotions, to our spiritual self, if you feel.
