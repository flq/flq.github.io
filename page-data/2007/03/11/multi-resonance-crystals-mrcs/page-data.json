It merely describes that the internal structure of this spatial entity is very ordered, its complexity arises from the intricate arrangement of very simple causal fields. Why I am using such weird words? Why not calling it a quantum field or something the like? Well, those fields are usually based and calibrated on certain characteristics of entities moving through the Spacetime continuum. In other words, their mass, their charge, their Spacetime relation to other entities with compatible properties, are the cornerstones of such fields. The activities that ensue in a MRC go beyond such concepts. Even those cornerstones are put into question within the realm of a MRC. A thing like charge becomes a variable much like a spatial coordinate that can also be altered through the interaction with other entities  representing charge or spin or other parameters that define a particle.

This is just an example, indeed there have been artists using the resonance properties of MRCs to create beautiful displays, highly complex patterns of light with sometimes astounding effects on an individual.

In this stage of so-called high purity, the MRC\\u2019s classical properties are essentially undefined. Charge, mass, spin or derived ones like hardness cannot be measured.

A multi-resonance crystal appears as if it is reflecting the light while also appearing at times transparent.

Leptons and Hadrons can be mathematically expressed within a single domain and a conversion between the two signifies an accumulation of parameters inside the MRC that have been detached from the previously available 4Band definition, the position in time and space of a given particle. What\\u2019s more, particles resulting from certain resonance interactions by injection of two or more particle streams into the crystal can have characteristics that were not available from previous particle streams flowing through the highly complex internal structure of the MRC.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","fields":{"slug":"/2007/03/11/multi-resonance-crystals-mrcs"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 11, 2007","path":null,"title":"Multi-resonance crystals (MRCs)","tags":["sci-fi"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Multi-resonance crystals (MRCs)","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/03/11/how-much-energy-does-a-swarmship-need-the-iis-energy-source","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"How much energy does a swarmship need?
