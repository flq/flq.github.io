Remember that one of the main characteristics of the crystals is that they leave most particle streams passing unharmed. Although the MRC is quite visible due to its distorting effect on the spatial coordinates of particles, it would be fatuous to touch a crystal. A finger goes right into the crystal and in practically all cases will not come out in the same way. Especially such complex molecules as they are found in bodies of life forms are rendered completely useless after an interaction with the internal properties of a MRC.

There are all kinds of secondary effects from simple glowing to strong radioactivity.
