In most of the cases the crystal turns into ordinary matter e.g. diamond or another crystalline carbon structure, or in some cases into hydrogen gas or a massive burst of high-energy photon radiation. As catastrophic as this discharge can occur, it is usually just a fraction of the energy stored in that specific type saturation. Most of the energy disappears into what can be best described as implosion towards regions of higher interaction frequencies i.e. frequencies greater than the ones defining the Spacetime domain. If this process (which is like any causal process non-instantaneous) occurs irregularly throughout the MRC it is when the crystal can shatter at great speeds due to the extreme changes in material properties and the arising shear forces. Combined with the great rotational speeds that can be accredited to the crystal\\u2019s \\u2018suprafluid\\u2019 core, you have to cope with a particle wave of devastating mechanical power leaving everything in its wake pulverized.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Rule number one\"), \": Keep your big MRCs in bunkers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Nonetheless the deeper reason for all those secondary effects is the implosion of the type imbalance away from our Spacetime domain.

This can be counteracted by rotating the crystal. And because the crystal has no weight, some quite astonishing revs can be achieved!

With the clamp breaking apart, the crystal remains attached to some of the parts.

By setting up and \\u2018charging\\u2019 a RIM, the effect of increased spatial blurriness (not necessarily the feature of \\u2018hiding type from spatial causality\\u2019) that is inherent to the MRC is expanded into the space surrounding the Crystal. It creates an environment that has similarities to the internal structure of an atom.

A RIM is somewhat like a magnifying glass \\u2013 It focuses onto an atomic structure and blows it up into dimensions that can be measured in metres. Along the spatial dimensions everything else is blown up, too. The magnitudes of energy encountered, the lifetime of particles, their spatial blurriness all become magnified, such that e.g. an electron-positron connection (positronium) can survive for seconds and can reach a spatial blurriness that covers a good deal of the RIMs total size. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In case you were wondering: RIMs vary greatly in size and shape, depending on the application. Technically, the smallest RIMs use spherical MRCs about 5 cm in diameter, while the total size of the RIM is also spherical and maybe about 20-30 cm in diameter. On Swarm ships of the biggest class, about 10-30 kilometres in size, you may find MRCs in use that are cylindrical and about 20 metres in diameter. With a cylindrical shape a typical bunker core must cater for RIMs with a diameter of up to 300 metres.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"If we strain the analogy to the model of a Hydrogen atom, the proton in the core is comparable to the MRC within a Rotating Interaction Matrix. It shares e.g. the behaviour of returning very quickly energy that is tried to be pressed into the RIM. A complete energetic chaos or very highly charged particles can be created just by fiddling a bit with the RIMs energy state. We are talking here of a saturated, or fully charged, stable RIMs. While limits are imposed by the strength of the Generators that help sustain the electromagnetic tomb and the possibilities of the Particle stream generators, the MRC also brings along a natural limit, known as the RIM saturation point. Overdoing this point can be quite unspectacular or not, depending on how stable the RIM had been before it was \\u2018overdone\\u2019. The MRC\\u2019s characteristic of interacting at greater interaction frequency bands becomes predominant and the complete RIM, i.e. the crystal and the surrounding particle web is sucked into the crystal\\u2019s fastest rotating axle. It now depends on whether the crystal keeps its properties to the bitter end, where the complete entity simply disappears without a trace. Normally a minuscule part of the crystal will fall into normal spatial behaviour (compare to the MRC\\u2019s saturation point), generating a lot of energetic chaos. A good deal of the energy usually reappears inside a sun as members of the particle zoo we know from Spacetime by following higher order interaction frequencies related to gravitational force fields. This can indeed be measured and it can actually affect a sun, but normally a sun is in comparison far too big and stable as to be destroyed by such an event.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \" More dangerous for a crew can be the scenario where the MRC\\u2019s characteristic of interacting at higher interaction frequencies becomes disturbed. Here most of the forces stored in the particle web cannot find a channel into the MRC and away from the spatial confinement of an electromagnetic field. A direct effect is a very explosive reaction, which can then itself disturb the MRC so much that it also releases stored energy from greater interaction frequencies into Spacetime. This is the worst-case scenario of a RIM breakdown and leads to sure death of the whole Spacecraft.  With the improvements over the millennia, such accidents are extremely rare. The sustainment of a perfectly aligned RIM has reached such perfections that in cases of misuse, the reaction is usually a near complete implosion that can be dealt with. Of course such situations have to be avoided due to the sheer value of MRCs.\"), mdx(\"hr\", null), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"*)\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"An acronym preferably used in advanced text books on the subject.
