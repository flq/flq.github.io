The Ii therefore consider an ELECTRON as well as heptillions and more electrons. Remember how we shortly considered a simple space in which energy could flow along a worldline? If we have an electron instance (you know, those particles we like to experiment with in silly double-slit experiments and what-have-you), it is in essence an energy flow though space, constrained by the SPACE entity as well as the ELECTRON entity (and other ENTITIES involved, represented by their reactive instances that shape the current reality configuration from that electron's point of view).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Do not be fooled that we are talking about the ELECTRON.

Our understanding of the things around us is based on the fact that from our point of view reality is constructed causally. Interaction leads to a different configuration of Spacetime and particle worldlines, which in turn constitute the initial conditions for the following interactions. Admittedly, this is the classical view of things. Quantum mechanics already has to think about issues of locality, causality and realism, most notably pointed out by experiments that deal with entanglement - alas, humanity so far has troubles to deal with this viewpoint. One of the reasons is surely that causality lies at the heart of mankind's physical modelling. Hence Quantum mechanics appears exceptional.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The Ii's reality model considers causality a concept that is built up from two atomic entities: A \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"source \"), \"and a \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"target \"), \"change.

So far energy transferrals have been considered that link entities into unique configurations. Even so, a source change can only be enacted if the source entity has energy available. The availability of energy _within _a given entity is nothing that we (or any other consciousness with a limited overview of all interactions) would be able to measure. Much could be written about this stuff, but at this point I only want to stress that an unrealized entity cannot be used for a source change - It will first have to experience a constructive change: A change that changes the entity's state from potential to real.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What I want to emphasize in a cumbersome way is that, although causality is not based on time, the 'current' configuration influences subsequent configurations.

According to the Ii those are the principal building blocks of our concrete reality, since they hide the inherent non-causal nature of reality. When interaction cycles are combined in configurations, one will find out that some cycles finish faster than others. This concept can be expanded to the basic assumption that changes to entities can precede (or succeed) one another. This is what the Ii refer to as interaction frequency.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Based on this knowledge, we have entities SPACE and TYPE that can indeed be the target and source of all changes related to all space points known to us. Their interaction frequency is far greater than the one of any space point. Our focus of consciousness in turn has (most of the time) an interaction frequency comparable to those space points. Which is why space appears coherent to us and yet we cannot see how the trick is done. Our ability to interact is massively slower than the ability of other entities to interact. Before we complete one of our cycles (a heartbeat, breathe in and out), the universe has 'redrawn' itself multiple times based on the constraining entities that shape the common structure of our Spacetime.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/20/interaction-frequency"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 20, 2007","path":null,"title":"Interaction frequency","tags":["sci-fi"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Interaction frequency","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/20/type","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"Type","tags":["sci-fi"],"date":"2007/02/20"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/21/my-current-dream-energy-generation-for-a-quick-car","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"My current dream energy generation for a quick car","tags":["technology"],"date":"2007/02/21"}}}}}
