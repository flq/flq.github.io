Only in combination with the complex molecules alongside additional molecules surrounding the DNA installed in the cell's membrane and core, does the DNA provide the basis to generate adequate responses to its surroundings. You can extract a cell's core and it will happily live on with the handicap that it cannot create new proteins. Try that with a  body's brain. If in turn you remove a cell's membrane, it is dead. It essentially lost its ability to 'think'.</p>\n<p>If Google wants to spend money on poor knowledge, bless them. Any buck dished out on people thinking about stuff is well spent.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/20/google-and-a-i"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 20, 2007","path":null,"title":"Google and A.I.","tags":["technology","biology"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Google and A.I.","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/19/update-to-drupal-5-1-check","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"Update to Drupal 5.1 - Check!","tags":["meta","tools"],"date":"2007/02/19"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/02/20/type","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"Type","tags":["sci-fi"],"date":"2007/02/20"}}}}}
