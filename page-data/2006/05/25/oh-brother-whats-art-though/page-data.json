You consider all sorts of things. Influences, the world around you, concepts or ideas. A piece of art is based on an idea. And since the final result of art, which can in itself be something requiring the time dimension to be fully understood, is a projection of an idea, the complete process from the idea up to its finalisation must be consistent in itself. In fact, for the artist to be able to create art, confidence is required in the rules that will aid in creating the outcome.\"), mdx(Beta, {\n    mdxType: \"Beta\"\n  }, \"Ah, yes, but ideas can and actually do change with time. And sometimes you must throw away an idea, because it is not feasible.\"), mdx(Alpha, {\n    mdxType: \"Alpha\"\n  }, \"Fair enough, but I think this is a different mechanism altogether.

My girl \", mdx(\"em\", null, \"is\"), \" art. And \", mdx(\"em\", null, \"juuust\"), \" a second. Thing is we actually see that sudden break in our set of rules from which an idea emerges.

Nonetheless you should rest assured that there is a consistent set of rules that projects the idea to a result that can be perceived as art. Either way, if the Universe is such a result, I expect a framework to be found that is time-invariant in the truest sense, meaning that meaningful applications of that frameworkt do not require a time parameter to be understood. After all, the time parameter is clearly set \", mdx(\"em\", null, \"within\"), \" our Universe, it is \", mdx(\"em\", null, \"part\"), \" of the object of art.

You watch too many lawyer-movies! But I see where you are getting at. Our current set of rules always require the time factor in order to be applied. And they are merely describing the look of our object of art. It indeed tells us nothing about the idea behind it. And those darned rules just fail at the point of the Big-Bang. If the Universe arises from an idea, which is my belief, it requires a consistent set of rules that does not depend on time. It is almost like the very rules that we use in describing the world are the result of an art creating process.\"), mdx(Alpha, {\n    mdxType: \"Alpha\"\n  }, \"Ain't it sweet?
