Via scienceblog (who quite apparently have upgraded to drupal 5 :): [Heat converted to power using organic molecules](http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/heat-converted-to-power-using-organic-molecules-12613.html). This is possibly asolution more suited to lower temperatures than a gas turbine dissipates, but I'd think that one of the reasons why a gas turbine does not appear feasible in a car is the loss of heat which cannot be put to good use in a small vehicle. Well, if we would have something like this...

Maybe it would be more feasible to pack in a turbine with its fantastic power density!
