Check out this piece of interactive ruby:

`
irb> create(:Car).with(:model, :bhp, :driver)
=> Car
irb> pos2 = Car.new("Ferrari 248 F1", 700, "Michael Schumacher")
=> #...
irb> "#{pos2.driver}'s new #{pos2.model} possibly has #{pos2.bhp} BHPs!"
=> "Michael Schumacher's new Ferrari 248 F1 possibly has 700 BHPs!"
`

I am really starting to love this sort of freedom!

I built the little create method to have a very quick way to get some objects with a couple of properties in interactive ruby. The day that I can extract my constructed objects out of irb will be met with Cocktail drinking at my flat.

The file to download contains the source code to the sweet lilâ€™ create method put into use up there
