This chapter lays out the major concepts that underpin the understanding, approach and Know-how of the **Ii** ship-builders.

Please note that the Ii science fiction is based on a book that I have written which is not yet available to the public in any way. This chapter entails the essence of this book. Since it is kept short (as its only meaning is to kick off the science-fiction bits on Ii technology), open questions will remain but that is just fine. At some point the book will be available and the underlying concepts are then explained in more detail.

As an introduction see a map of the concept introduced in this groundwork section:
