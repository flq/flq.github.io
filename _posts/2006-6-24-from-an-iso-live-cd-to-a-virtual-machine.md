[vmwarez.com: LiveCD Player Virtual Machine](http://www.vmwarez.com/2006/02/livecd-player-virtual-machine.html) - this blog entry presents a small *no idea how you could call it* to hook up a live CD (iso image) as virtual machine that runs in vmplayer. This is pretty lovely since there are quite a few Virtual machines around. [This one here](http://www.brianketelsen.com/pages/download) was mentioned via digg. It provides some Linux flavor with mysql installed as well as all stuff required to develop RoR applications. Great! To get into developing rails is then a matter of downloading the image and make set it up to run in your vmware player!
