In this case I am trying the [Windows Live Writer](http://get.live.com/betas/writer_betas)&nbsp;to figure our whether there is a better way to post to my weblog. Clearly, for simple text this looks pretty straightforward, but it is rather unlikely that my posts containing code could be written with this. On the other hand, it is almost heartwarming to see how this Microsoft product is working seamlessly with my Drupal installation. Maybe the world is becoming a better place after all!
