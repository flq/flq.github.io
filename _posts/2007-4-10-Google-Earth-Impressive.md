After some break I downloaded Google Earth (GE) once again. My parents were here and during a small walk in the Schwarzwald near St. Peter with its [abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Abbey_in_the_Black_Forest) we wondered how a certain mountain would be called which can be seen from there and which still was carrying snow. GE incorporation of height data allows to pinpoint pretty well certain features of the landscape. Respect! And for those who need visual prove that GE can be pretty awesome here a view that has been photographed millions of times:
