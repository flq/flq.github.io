Well, here goes a couple of Screenshots from [Thawmadoce][1], that project 
that helps me to post my blog posts. Gosh, it is still quite Alpha, (there is no support for entering images, e.g. :) if you think about it, but anyway.

## Your start page, 
...unless you have been writing without saving yet.<br>
![New file](/public/assets/thawmadoce_screenshots/thaw_scr1.png "New file")

## The app Menu 
...opens upon click or via shortcuts. Shortcuts are always shown in the tooltip, that way you can gradually learn to use thawmadoce purely via keystrokes

## Showing text
![showing some text](/public/assets/thawmadoce_screenshots/thaw_scr3.png "showing some text")

## Selection bar
The selection bar shows up when you select text. The solution ain't perfect, but the aim is to have as much a clean sheet as possible when writing text

## Preview

## Using a plugin
The plugin to post to my site is rather crude, but that is not thawmadoce's concern, it just provides the plugin capabilities
