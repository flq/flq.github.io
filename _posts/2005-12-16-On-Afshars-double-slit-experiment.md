Last year a big story was placed in the Newscientist stating that things thought about the impossiblity of looking at both sides of the wave/particle duality coin were untrue and that a special way of performing the double-slit experiment would allow to consider both aspects of a subatomic particle.
 This essay on arxiv is related to just that experiment and states in turn that complementarity is still given and that Mr. Afshar should get back at designing the experiment further. [Go here](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512123).
