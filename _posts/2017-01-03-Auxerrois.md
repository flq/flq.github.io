_Really_, there are sometimes things I have no clue where to put them,
but I don't want to lose them. Took me a shameful amount of time to figure out
that my __blog__ _is the best place to put them_.

Without further ado, a wine we bought today. Good to fish, but not
super-dry, from our neighbors in the Alsace region.
