There I go. I updated my CMS to Drupal 6, and with it I am using a new site template.

Sadly, though, a couple of things are broken and just now I am being nastily spammed and all possible tools of defence won't work as expected for now. I kind of hate upgrading, for exactly those reasons. I'll spend some time on it, though, and hope all will work well again soon.
