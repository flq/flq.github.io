It is my aim to have this site running on .NET code by the time I can leave my current hosting contract (end of February 2010).

After some time I decided to have my own small platform to support just the features I need on my site for mainly two reasons. I found the available platforms too large in that they have more features than I really want. Secondly, I want to sharpen my skills in the chosen technology stack (ASP.NET MVC & friends, NHibernate & friends).

Even so, the resulting code isn't necessarily tied to my content - hence, I am now keeping the Rf.Sites code [here on github](http://github.com/flq/Rf.Sites).
