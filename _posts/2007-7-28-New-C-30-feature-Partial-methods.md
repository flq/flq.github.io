This feature is apparently available with the Beta 2 of VS 2008 (Orcas). I need not say much apart from stating my opinion that it looks like quite a useful, straightforward addition to a world of generated code living peacefully alongside your own code in a rich, interactive fashion.

You can read an excellent rundown of the feature, its capabilities and its limitations, over here:  [C# 3.0 partial methods - What, why and how?](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/07/28/c-3-0-partial-methods-what-why-and-how.aspx)
