It is pretty much a month ago since I last wrote something here. There have been holidays, a cold, much work and interesting settings. However, nothing that changes much right now. Such is life...sometimes you hang around, wait, sometimes it moves on quickly. Well, I wouldn&#39;t be the first one that writes about nothing!  

Either way, has anything impressed me lately? Not really, I am afraid. Most of news have nothing in there to impress me...the media apparently has figured out that fear sells best, and now even Operas succumb to it. Sad, really. I wouldn&#39;t have minded if they&#39;d argue that decapitating religious leaders (including Buddha, who isn&#39;t a religious leader, and also Mohammed and Jesus certainly were far more faceted than the guys described in the respective books, since those have been tools to empower a few to take control over many over numerous years - and then Poseidon? I mean, c&#39;mon, he is actually the odd one out in the list!) is just plain stupid, bears no sensible message and is simply to shock and offend numerous people who try to live a decent live, trying to respect other people and not killing anybody or beating others to a pulp. Anyway... 

Recently I came across a paper in arxiv that I could understand to a certain degree and that was quite interesting: [Quantum mechanics: Myths and facts](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609163). Certain conceptions about QM that we take for granted in fact do not necessarily have to be so. The problem remains that QM is not understood at a conceptual level and that it&#39;s understanding of space and time remains hugely different to the concepts of general relativity.  How is reality really build up? And if somebody is going to say that this is a question for philosophy, then please go reading elsewhere. I want this question answered, if only to find that reality IS inherently based on our OWN conceptions.

Looking through my del.icio.us it looks that I stored a decent link on ruby lately:  [ruby metaprogramming techniques](http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2006/09/ruby-metaprogramming-techniques.html). From a quick glance it looks like a nice summary on how to tackle challenges in ruby the metaprogramming way.

Right, heavy day tomorrow, less go.
