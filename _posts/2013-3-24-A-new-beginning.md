If all goes well, this should be the first post that enters the website through my dropbox - realfiction has then reached *the cloud*
The reason behind this is, once more, reducing the friction to do something. In this case, I type my posts in [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/), save the file in a dropbox folder, and (*theoretically*) 5 minutes later max the post miraculously appears on my website.

Well, we shall see...
