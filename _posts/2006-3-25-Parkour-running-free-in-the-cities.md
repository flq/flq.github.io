 Parkour, or free running, is quite amazing to watch - Houses, walls and stairs simply become parts of the way that skilled people take to get from A to B. This video is from a French documentary mostly showing David Belle and his gang. France appears to be at the centre of this movement. That way, the catastrophic ghettos they build over there have done some good. When the latest installment of the Bond series hits the cinemas, [Sebastien Foucan](http://www.parkour.com/), another dazzling master of Parkour, will be able to show off some of his skills to an unsuspecting audience.
