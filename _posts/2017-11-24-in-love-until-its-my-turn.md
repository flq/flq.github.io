Mourning the loss of a loved one surely is a private matter. LetÂ´ not forget that if we see a sad face in the streets, or an angry reaction by somebody, that this person may be having a really rough time processing the loss of one of the most important people in their life.

This post, however, wants to focus on a specific subject of public relevance. I have lost the one person I know who has consciously witnessed the second World War.

Reaching the age of 80 is OK to good, depending on how you live your life. There is no denying, however, that the witnesses of WWII are going away. Soon, the most horrible war in the history of humanity, will strike as much fear into the hearts of pupils as the 30-year-war, the crusades, or any other of the countless wars that happened in the past.

### None.

My Dad, on the other hand, could never let go of those years in his childhood. The bombs, the burning houses. The dead, the chaos, the despotism, the hate and spitefulness. The self-hate. In retrospect, it's hard to believe what a good person he was with that background. So many people were shattered by the war. I never met one of my granddads. They withered away long before I came to life.

The upbringing in Germany didn't leave me untouched. I grew up aware of the atrocities committed by the Nazis. When I came studying in England, in the beginning it was hard for me to take in how nonchalantly Hitler was built into humour (Fawlty Towers, anyone?). _Unpossible_ in Germany when I was young. Can you actually believe, a German studying in the UK, with the aid of EU funding?

It is for people like my father that made this possible. He was a businessman. So he made business. With Spanish people, French, Belgian, British, Italian, Greek and who knows who else. He had some preconceptions about people of those nations (some appear to be right ;) ), but he enjoyed working with them. Those people are the foundation of the EU we have come to love.

> (for the record: I don't love excessive bureaucracy, but I enjoy going to France to buy cheese and fish, not noticing a border, because there is none, paying the same currency and using internet because there is no fucking roaming! If you force me to choose between a bureaucratic government or dying on the front, I know I'll choose the former)

My Dad couldn't believe that the same stinking brown sludge is pouring out of the sewers of the nations again. He thought that we'd learned. He mostly despised Germans. He loved the US for having put the final nail into the coffin wherein lies the Nazi regime. 

I couldn't ask him whether he thought that other nations would be capable of the same atrocities. He may have believed that the Germans were special in that respect.

Me, I don't think so. Everywhere where

* Democratic representatives cannot be trusted anymore to do as they say
* The wealthy think that they are actually better than the rest and are entitled to even more
* Institutions fail to rigorously weed out the stinking filth that always forms at the bottom of any living system and begin to show blind eyes towards certain groups of people

__You will get Nazis__. If you let them prosper, they will __ensnare the people__ by channeling the anger and vile that the above points accumulate in a society. They will tap on the __racism__ that is directly related to a lack of education and exposure to different viewpoints. They will get __cocky__. They will erode the institutions while sweet-talking you into parting with your morale, your ethics and utimately your soul. They will happily __throw your body into a meat grinder__ if it furthers their Agenda.

When institutions start failing to act, there will be only one language left that Nazis understand. Violence to the death.

Because the normal people, they seem unable to counteract it.
