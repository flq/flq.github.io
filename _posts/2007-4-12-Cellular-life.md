You wouldn't think that's it's just about DNA, now, would you?

Here is an amazing animation from Harvard University showing some of the processes involved in having a white blood cell move and react to a source of inflammation.

There is a lot of talk that may leave you stumped so here just a few pointers:

*   [Cytosol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol) - Internal fluid of the cell
*   [Lipids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipids) - Check out the link, to be honest I am not quite sure but it seems like lipids play the role of _structuring_
*   [Proteins ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) - so essential I can't really think of any single phrase on those.
*   [Ribosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomes) - aid in building e.g. proteins
*   [Endoplasmatic Reticulum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmatic_reticulum) performs protein and lipid synthesis and transportation.
*   [Golgi Apparatus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_apparatus) modifies, sorts, and packages macromolecules created in the cell e.g. for secretion to the outside.
*   [Mitochondrion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria) the cell's energy plants
*   [Vesicles ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_%28biology%29)- Compartments made of lipid layer(s) that allow to transport stuff (like waste etc.) around the cell
*   [Centrosome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome) - functions within the internal structure and movement of a cell and seems to be involved in cell division
