Welcome my new user, Retro Mandrel *grin*. Well, he isn&#39;t that new of a user. His first (and only) appearance was on my very first webpage back in 97. This guy is Captain of a transporter, the Limelight. A dodgy character, and his crew isn&#39;t much better. I had some hearty laughs reading the old stuff, and I felt like giving this guy just what a captain needs...A log. Read it if you wish...
