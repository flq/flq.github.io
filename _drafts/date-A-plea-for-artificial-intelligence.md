Recently I have been surprised by people of certain public exposure to reflect upon artificial intelligence (AI) and that this is a threat to humanity.

Apart from the mounting empiric evidence that the biggest threat to humanity is humanity (regardless of our ability to create artificial intelligence), I do think that we should welcome a new life-form instead of demonizing it before it is even born.

Whatever definition of AI you use, you probably agree that this is a broad term, hence let me define a different term for it.
