About 11 years ago I started an attempt to distil many conversations and thoughts into what could be a very simple _core_ as to how reality could be constructed.
Over the course of 3-5 years I wrote a number of chapters and arrived at some sort of conclusion. And the the text hung around, and I didn't know what to do with it for a number of reasons.

* Is it a _philosophical_ text or a _mathematical_ text? 
* What is the target group
* String theory/ies are a prime example for an exercise in futility since they predict nothing falsifiable. The very essence of the book seemed to be to describe a framework with which to _build_ a concrete reality as we observe in the form of our universe. By definition it should be able to produce any result that is in agreement with observations.

With time my beliefs also began to shift. At the time I wrote the book I was, how to describe, more spiritually minded. One of the motivations of writing _From Nothing to All_ was to reconcile some core concepts of spirituality (a layer of energy beyond phenomenology, causality as a derived concept, layers of reality) with "Western" terminology.

Then, in 2012 or 13 I heard about Jill Bolte Taylor in this [incredible Radiolab episode][1]. Her stroke reduced her to her right brain hemisphere, causing in her that state of mind that you usually accredit to deep meditation. This left me thinking that that deep spiritual connection could just be you minus the chitchat of your ego.
