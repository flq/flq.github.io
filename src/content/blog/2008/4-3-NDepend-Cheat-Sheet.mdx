Some of you have heard of NDepend. The tool comes loaded with metrics that can be checked from fields up to namespaces and assemblies with the aid of Code Query Language (CQL) statements. Some of those metrics did not want to enter my head easily, which is why I made a cheat sheet of those metrics that need just a little bit of explanation. [You can download it here](/assets/NDependMetricsCheatSheet.pdf).

A fairly detailed description of just the metrics can be found at ndepend itself:
