The DI container StructureMap has been coming along nicely lately, with version 2.5.1 [available as download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/structuremap). I have been following closely its recent development, since it is providing some core object wiring functionality to my current project.

A rather inviting pattern one can be lured into in DI container usage is using the container as service locator:

    public ShippingScreenPresenter()
    {
      _service = ObjectFactory.GetInstance<IShippingService>();
      _repository = ObjectFactory.GetInstance<IRepository>();
    }

(This example is taken straight from Jeremy's [recent StructureMap post](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/01/07/autowiring-in-structuremap-2-5.aspx))

As simple as it looks, splattering references to some "ObjectFactory" all over your code contradicts why you may be using the container in the first place: To simplify keeping concerns separated and removing responsibility of instantiation from classes, thereby simplifying coding against abstractions.

StructureMap also has the notion of named instances, i.e. objects that are not retrieved as default but are rather stored under a key which must be used to retrieve said instance again. StructureMap can even provide you with named instances (or custom instances) when doing constructor-based injection. It may look something like that (taken from a StructureMap registry, the place to configure object dependencies):


    ForRequestedType<Form>()
      .CacheBy(InstanceScope.Singleton)
      .TheDefault.Is.OfConcreteType<MainForm>()
      .CtorDependency<IApplicationModule>().Is(a=>a.TheInstanceNamed("MainModule"));

In another scenario I have the problem that a class needs to obtain instances based on code that will provide an instance name. Here starting to use the ObjectFactory as service locator is ever so inviting. However, there is a simple way to provide some straightforward decoupling from the ObjectFactory. I delegate the resolving of object to an...ObjectResolver. This class is generic and the provided type argument sets what kind of types are being looked up. The implementation is very straightforward:

    public class ObjectResolver<T> where T : class
    {
      public virtual T this[string key] { 
        get { 
          return ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance<T>(key); 
        }
      }
    }

Now I can express the dependency to an ObjectResolver as with any other type in the constructor:

    public class CommandMediator {
      ctor(ObjectResolver<ICommand> cmdResolver) {
        ...
      }

      public void Foo() {
        var cmd = cmdResolver["Save"];
        Assert.That(cmd != null);
      }
    }


In what way is this better than doing service locating?

*   For a common scenario, the tie to StructureMap for resolving named instances is reduced to a single class.
*   If you wanted, replacing the lookup scheme for instances is fairly easy.
*   Since the ObjectResolver is a concrete class, StructureMap can effortlessly instantiate it such that you don't need a single line of configuration to use it.
*   You can satisfy a dependency to the ObjectResolver without instantiating any DI container.

Check out the following code that uses [Rhino Mocks](http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx) to provide a satisfying response within a test:

    public void MediatorWillInstantiateSaveCommand {
      var cmd = new Command();
      var resolver = MockRepository.GenerateMock<ObjectResolver<ICommand>>();
      resolver.Expect(r=>r[null]).Constraints(Is.Equal("Save")).Return(cmd);
      var mediator = new CommandMediator(resolver);
      mediator.Foo();
      resolver.VerifyAllExpectations();
    }

What I am trying to say is: Put some effort into your code when you see yourself using a DI Container as Service Locator. It is most likely to pay off in several ways.
