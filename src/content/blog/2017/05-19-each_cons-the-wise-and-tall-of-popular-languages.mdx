A few days ago, Michael Feathers tweeted this:

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact that many simple correct Ruby programs become ridiculously complex when translated to other languages means something.</p>&mdash; Michael Feathers (@mfeathers) <a href="https://twitter.com/mfeathers/status/864122686695460866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, I am not a complete [stranger to ruby][1], which is why this statement resonated with me, and upon requesting an example, Michael came up with this:

```ruby
([0] + arr).each_cons(2).count {|x,y| x == 0 && y == 1 }
```

> [each_cons][2] is a function that provides consecutive elements

This does indeed show off ruby's expresiveness quite nicely:

* A simple syntax to concatenate lists
* A rich set of libraries for manipulation of things (I am referring to the _each\_cons_)
* The syntax of ruby's yields and blocks, which have been used so many times as the syntactical basis for DSLs

The fact that the parameter influences how many items will be yielded into
your block reminds us why all of us like to write Javascript once in a while.

__What about other languages then?__

## F&#35;

Let's look at the code which performs (almost) the same job:

```fsharp
seq { yield 0; yield! {1..4} }
  |> Seq.pairwise 
  |> Seq.filter (fun (x,y) -> x = 0 && y = 1)
  |> Seq.length
```

It is pretty compact and readable, but even though some things look
similar, they actually use completely different mechanics of the 
language

* The first line is a [computational expression to generate sequences][4] which provides
  us with a pretty syntax for concatenating elements and lists of elements
* The _pairwise_ is the closest we get to _each\_cons_
* The _length_ does not have a version where we can provide a filter condition, so we 
  need to specify the filter beforehand.
* The _pairwise_ method provides a tuple which is then pattern matched into two arguments in the
  lambda to _filter_.

Of note is that _pairwise_ will provide exactly 2 consecutive elements of a list, it 
does not allow a parameter like the ruby version. This makes sense, since F\# is statically typed.
If you wanted a version that provides 3 consecutive elements, you would have to write a method
yourself that yields an element of type __(a,a,a)__.
  
## C&#35;

To actually achieve the same level of expressiveness we need to put some work into this:

![](/assets/csharp_cons.jpg)

With those two additional extension methods we can now write

```csharp
0.ToEnumerable().Concat(arr).Windowed().Count(t => t.x == 0 && t.y == 1);
```

While tuples are now available in c#, you cannot deconstruct them like you can do in most other
functional languages or even in ES2016 
(which has actually gone to great lengths to make deconstruction a dependable feature).

While I can kind of forgive a missing _each\_cons_-like BCL method, I write the _ToEnumerable_ again in almost every project. I mean, that method is the damned [unary return operation][6]!

## Kotlin

Xavier Lepaul chimed in with a view on what Kotlin is up to with respect to the challenge:


<Tweet tweet={`<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/mfeathers">@mfeathers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/fquednau">@fquednau</a> Kotlin is almost there (with <a href="https://t.co/b2TpoX5LqA">https://t.co/b2TpoX5LqA</a>)<br>(listOf(0) + arr).windowed(2).count {(x,y) -&gt; x == 0 &amp;&amp; y == 1}</p>&mdash; Xavier Lepaul (@xlepaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/xlepaul/status/864404258476752896">May 16, 2017</a></blockquote>`} />


```kotlin
(listOf(0) + arr).windowed(2).count {(x,y) -> x == 0 && y == 1}
```

This doesn't fall very short of the ruby example, however, the _windowed_ is not available yet in
Kotlin 1.1 - What I particularly liked is that even though the type signature of _windowed_ is

```kotlin
fun <T> Iterable<T>.windowed(size: Int, step: Int): List<List<T>>
```
i.e. returning a list of lists, one can still deconstruct the list into the x and y you can
see in the lambda provided to _count_. This works because the deconstruction in kotlin simply 
starts working when the deconstructed object provides methods named _component1_ down to 
_componentN_. A quick look at Kotlin's list type...

Kudos to the Kotlin team which make a language that feels functional with strategies that are
very different to a "real" functional language. I have been an outsider to the JVM most of my
time, but when you get to know Java and Kotlin I really cannot fathom what exactly would make you
stick to Java.

## Type safety vs elegance?

In order for ruby and Kotlin to shine in this example, both pay up by allowing misunderstandings
in API use to surface only at runtime. Note that in both languages the compiler will happily allow
you to capture more or less output than _each\_cons_/_windowed_ actually provides. This seems to be
the price you need to pay for such an API, since the output _"type"_ is determined by the argument to the windowing function. Now if there was a language where types 
could be determined programmatically...

## Idris

[Idris][7] is a programming language which is close in spirit to Haskell but adds the capability 
to define _dependent types_.

In this language, we can define the following type signature for a method:

```haskell
window : (n : Nat) -> List a -> List (Vect n a)
```

This describes a method that takes a natural number __n__, 
and a list containing things with type __a__ and then returns a list containing vectors of length __n__. __n__ has now become part of the type definition for __Vect__. With much help
(I couldn't see how to make the leap from the variable length __List a__ to the type __Vect n a__),
this is then one possible implementation of _windowed_ in Idris: 

```haskell
total
takeExact : (n : Nat) -> (xs : List a) -> Maybe (Vect n a)
takeExact Z xs = Just []
takeExact (S n) [] = Nothing
takeExact (S n) (x :: xs) with (takeExact n xs)
  takeExact (S n) (x :: xs) | Nothing = Nothing
  takeExact (S n) (x :: xs) | (Just v) = Just (x :: v)


total
window : (n : Nat) -> List a -> List (Vect n a)
window n xs with (takeExact n xs)
  window n xs | Nothing = []
  window n [] | (Just ys) = []
  window n (x :: xs) | (Just ys) = ys :: window n xs
```
> _total_ tells the Idris compiler to check the method whether it is indeed total as far as 
> Idris is capable to tell. Total means that this method is guaranteed to return for whatever
> input that is provided. __Z__ and __S__ are types representing __Zero__ 
> and __Successor__ within the Natural number type.

Now we can use the window function to write down the example provided.

```haskell
--with
condition : Vect 2 Integer -> Bool
condition [x,y] = x == 0 && y == 1

*hello> length $ filter condition (window 2 $ 0::[1,2,3,4])
1 : Nat
```

It is also pretty compact, with the _little_ difference that the filter function provided must
deconstruct a Vector of type __Vect 2 Integer__, based on the arguments to the _window_ function. That is, in your function you are forced to take the vector as a whole or deconstruct to exactly
the right size that is provided.

Why is all this interesting? Because it is sometimes plain _fun_ to compare different programming
languages. They present to you different ways of thinking, different ways to express your intentions. One common theme is that conciseness comes when you get close to functional programming idioms. Also, before this post I didn't think that you could actually expand upon the
Haskell type system, but you can. Alas, we also have to recognize the great popularity of languages like ruby. Reasoning with types requires much practice, but help you squash bugs before you even get to the runtime. Languages like javascript and ruby reward you quickly when you get your act together, but depend on decent documentation to get API usage right.

Hence, ruby is indeed expressive, but quite a few popular languages have learned to recreate that expressiveness with the possibilities that their respective runtimes provide.
