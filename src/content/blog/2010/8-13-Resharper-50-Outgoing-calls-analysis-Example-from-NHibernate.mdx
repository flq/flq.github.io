The following is a screenshot when you start off from NHibernate’s default OnLoad listener (called e.g. when you say **session.Load&lt;Cat&gt;(23)**).

![NhibernateLoadEntity](/assets/NhibernateLoadEntity_3.png "NhibernateLoadEntity") 

I’ve cut out other outgoing calls to show you the level of abstraction between loading an Entity and hitting the ExecuteReader() method of ADO.NET’s low-level API.

You can access this functionality in Resharper 5 by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A, giving you a small menu to show you the type hierarchy, incoming and outgoing calls. A nice tool to find your way around an unfamiliar codebase.
