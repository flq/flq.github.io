To be honest, without [this blog post](http://www.rudigrobler.net/Blog/screen-conductor-101) on [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/) I was kind of stuck. But now I ended up with my Screen conductor, and it’s likely that it is not going to change a lot:

```csharp
[Single]
public class ShellViewModel : Conductor<Screen>
{
    private readonly IDisposable screenStreamDispose;

    public ShellViewModel(IObservable<RequestToActivateScreen> screenStream)
    {
        screenStreamDispose = screenStream
            .SubscribeOnDispatcher()
            .Where(msg=>msg.ScreenAvailable)
            .Subscribe(onNextScreenRequest);
    }

    private void onNextScreenRequest(RequestToActivateScreen request)
    {
        ActivateItem(request.Screen);
    }

    protected override void OnDeactivate(bool close)
    {
        screenStreamDispose.Dispose();
        base.OnDeactivate(close);
    }
}
```

The Observable is constructed based on **MemBus**. The screenStream is shaped with the aid of the reactive framework while “**ActivateItem**” loads the corresponding view for the given Screen. Overriding **OnDeactivate** gives a nice place to dispose of a subscription. The whole code is to be found in the [MemBus “Hello World” App](http://github.com/flq/MemBus/tree/master//Membus.WpfTwitterClient/).
