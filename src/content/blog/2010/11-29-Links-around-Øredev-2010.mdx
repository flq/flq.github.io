The Swedes don’t seem to be the fastest people on Earth when it comes to making available the videos that were taken from the sessions. But, it seems they are trickling through this channel: [Øredev's videos](http://vimeo.com/user2649908/videos)

There have been numerous wrap-ups form other people on the web, mostly appearing through the twitter stream with the #oredev hashtag.
