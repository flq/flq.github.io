It took me longer than expected to support this script, but itâ€™s available in the current source now:

 ```yaml
 Project "Default"

  Target "Default"
    @files <= smallPNGs -Capture:FullName, Extension
    Message "%(files.Identity) and extension %(files.Extension)"

  PS:smallPNGs <<END
    echo "Returning small pngs"
    cd C:\users\xyz\Documents
    Get-ChildItem -Recurse | 
    Where-Object { $_.Extension -eq ".png" -and $_.Length -lt 7000 } | 
    select FullName, Extension
  END
```

The syntax used is described in more detail in the [new syntax section](https://github.com/flq/rfb/wiki/Syntax:-Powershell-integration) on the rfb source site wiki. 

What happens is that this is the first of a couple of use cases surrounding a seamless integration of PowerShell with MSBuild. So far, you can define PowerShell.scripts, use them to fill item groups, and use those item groups in MSBuild tasks. <del>When the integration is feature complete you will be able to</del>The integration allows you to

*   Capture a single output value of PowerShell directly into a property 
* Run a PowerShell script without expecting any output 
* Write the PowerShell scripts inline in your targets as if they were MsBuild tasks 
* Pass parameters into your script 
* Have the PowerShell scripts log into the same Console that rfb is running in.
