Lately I've seen a few posts that have critiqued react for being a pretty complex thing. 
After having worked intensely with react for more than 5 years I would certainly attest to the honeymoon being over.
It's not that I hate the framework or anything like that, it's that some things can get really complicated.

Especially with **hooks** which, when they came to react felt to me like _react coming home_, one can now say in retrospect that
being part of the very function that is being called for rendering opens up to a whole host of possible issues. 
You need to make sure that you don't use any state that is stale and does not belong to what is currently 
being shown to the user. 

Of course all of this is etched into the mechanics of **dependency arrays**, a compromise between satisfying the rendering mechanics
of react (only render when things really change) and satisfying the basic rules of closing over state in functions within functions.

Today I bring you the example of a long running function that "_uploads multiple items_" while giving feedback to the UI user.

Let's have a look at the uploading component:

<GHEmbed repo="react-issues-1" branch="baseline" file="src/Uploader.jsx" start={4} end={15} />

The code _"uploads"_ three items, simulating the action with a `setTimeout` in async form, and then informs a user of the component that
the item has been completed via `onItemCompleted`, providing the item. Once all items have been processed a final event (`onAllCompleted`) is raised.

The consumer might look something like this:

<GHEmbed repo="react-issues-1" branch="baseline" file="src/App.jsx" start={5} end={22} />

Every time that `onItemCompleted` is raised, we add to the state we're keeping for having the items available. Then, once we get the
signal that all items are processed, we show all items to the user.

Nice, let's see then what the user gets to see with this code:

<Video width="568" height="352" name="react-try1.mp4" />

According to the code I would have expected that

* On each item completed event, I get to see all items that have been added to my list of items already
* When the all completed event is raised I get to do sth with all those items that have been collected up to that point.

But why? As a solid react dev I didn't use any of the dangerous stuff like `useCallback` etc where a dependency array needs 
to be defined... all my functions are fresh, are they not?

Here is the point where I let you think what is happening...

What is happening is that even though all kinds of things around the `upload` function in the Uploader change because we are 
triggering rerenders and what-have-you, the initial `upload` instance that was called is still running through its lifetime,
using all those references that were closed over the moment the `Uploader` rendered for the first time.

But Frank, you say, how the hell am I supposed to avoid that? The uploader runs for as long as it has to run - how can we make this fly
nonetheless?

That's what we'll look at in the next post.
