I am extremely tired by the oil industry. They're killing us by killing the planet. 

An industry that [bought Tram companies in US cities in order to 
close them down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy#) 
(Yes, I am conflating the car industry with the oil industry, sue me).

An industry that can routinely amass externalities that in essence go into billions and billions of Dollars.
Respiratory illnesses, envirnomental destruction, you name it, not to speak of wars fought around that godforsaken
bio-mass from the past.

An industry that [gets away with making the drug addict the culprit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/big-oil-coined-carbon-footprints-to-blame-us-for-their-greed-keep-them-on-the-hook),
and [keeps lying](https://rmi.org/oil-and-gas-companies-are-missing-significant-methane-emissions-heres-how-to-fix-that/) every step along their "value chain".

We're the lung cancer patient who keeps smoking. No respect for nobody.

Disgusting.
