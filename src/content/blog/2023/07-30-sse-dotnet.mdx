[Server-Sent Events][sse] (SSE) is an interesting extension of a HTTP response that generalizes rules on how to send responses 
down an open connection to the client and a javascript API on how to consume this data as it comes in (this in the next post). That way we can add some
_"realtime"_ capabilities to our web application provided that a uni-directional communication from server to client is sufficient.

SSE allows a lot more than this demo has implemented, last but not least around the interrruption of the connection.

The basics on how to send SSEs from a dotnet backend are very well described in the post 
["Server-side Event Streams with Dotnet Core and TypeScript"][1] by _Wim Jongeneel_, an Engineer located in Rotterdam. In fact,
some of the code contained in [the repo I'll be drawing code from][2] you will recognize as coming relatively straight from his post.

What is added in this demo above the extension methods of sending data down the wire with the aid of the `HttpResponse` object is 
how one can leverage [dotnet minimal API][3] infrastructure to __decouple__ how your _business code_ may send events from 
the actual mechanics.

For this we introduce an object that implements `IResult`- this interface is understood by the minimal API infrastructure and 
marks the result of an HTTP endpoint:

<GHEmbed repo="sse-demo" branch="develop" file="SSEDemo/SSEResult.cs" start={3} end={32} />

By passing an `IAsyncEnumerable` into a custom `IResult` object we have a nice way of providing a source of elements 
that can be mapped 1:1 to events sent to the client.

One constraint that we apply to the provided items is that they provide a `Name` and a `Payload` property which will be used 
to define under what event name the data will be sent to the client.

<GHEmbed repo="sse-demo" branch="develop" file="SSEDemo/SSEResult.cs" start={34} end={38} />

Armed with this handling of an `IAsyncEnumerable` one can use it in this way:

<GHEmbed repo="sse-demo" branch="develop" file="SSEDemo/Program.cs" start={8} end={8} />

`ProduceEvents` could be anything, e.g. the return of a MediatR call or however you call your business logic. 
In this case it is a simple demo function like this one:

<GHEmbed repo="sse-demo" branch="develop" file="SSEDemo/Program.cs" start={13} end={22} />

Also of note is that in this code, a special "Close" event will be sent. In the spec there doesn't seem to be anything specific
to how the server can end the connection (It's the client's responsibility to say good-bye), but by having a special event
we can trigger that the client should close the SSEs response.

In the next post we'll have a look at how the data provided by the API can be put to good use in a web page.
