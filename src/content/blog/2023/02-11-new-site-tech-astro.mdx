Under the _"site"_ tag I always inform about the technology changes that my website undergoes. The source still resides on github ([since 2014][1]) After a miserable attempt to upgrade gatsby ([which came after jekyll][2]), I was rather lucky to hear about [Astro.build][astro].

The way how things are cut into components will feel quite familiar to someone who knows react. Documentation, CLI, and how things are organized feels professional, and I am far more confident performing changes to my site after 2 weeks working on the migration than I ever was with gatsby.

So welcome to realfiction **v9** :)
