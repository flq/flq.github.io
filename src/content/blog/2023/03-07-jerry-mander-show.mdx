I was surprised to notice that I never mentioned "The Jerry Mander show", 
a little game I wrote around the rules of gerrymandering (I wrote [about that here][1]). 
The source code [can be found here][code] and there is a [playable version hosted over here][game]. Unfortunately I only have two "maps".
I'd love to add more challenges, so if you have cool setups, let me know.
