I like to use certain categories when classifying the outcomes of a round of wordle.


### Green city in sunlight

Requires

* A consecutive area of green blocks
* A single yellow block in the upper area

Here's an example:

### City on Tatooine

Requires

* A consecutive area of green blocks
* Two non-adjacent yellow blocks in the upper area

Here's an example:

### Tetries completeness

A wordle is Tetris-complete when, given that a game of Tetris would be running, no block 
would follow gravity, leaving the next tick of the game in the same state as the current one

Here's some examples:

Tetris-incompleteness is measured in steps
