To recap the last post - one issue this combination of components faces is that
the asynchronous upload method closed over functions which in turn closed over state that
gets stale over time.

<Info>
    There is always the option to redesign components such that you don't get into bad situations like this.
    One possibility would be for the uploader to keep track of the uploaded items and provide the full list of items
    to the `onAllCompleted` callback as argument.
</Info>

One of the two issues we can resolve with the `useState` overload that provides us with the current state:

<GHEmbed repo="react-issues-1" branch="fixes" file="src/App.jsx" start={12} end={14} />

This fixes the `onItemCompleted` callback. But what about `onAllCompleted` ?

To show you one more tool from our arsenal of circumventing staleness in function components, 
let's make sure that the Uploader always sees the latest version of the onAllCompleted callback:

On every render of `Uploader`, we'll write the passed in props into a ref:

<GHEmbed repo="react-issues-1" branch="fixes" file="src/Uploader.jsx" start={4} end={6} />

And from now on we access the props through the ref:

<GHEmbed repo="react-issues-1" branch="fixes" file="src/Uploader.jsx" start={8} end={15} />

Now the `uploadAsync` function has access to the last set of functions that were passed in during the last render. 
Once `onAllCompleted` is called, it is the one that _sees_ the latest version of the items state from App.

I hope you'll enjoy this little ref hack and you might find it useful here & there.
