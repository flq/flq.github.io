For the past year i've had plenty of possibility to get my head around WPF as a UI technology. 
In that time a number of frameworks have crystallized that in their combination makes writing good WPF Apps, let's say, bearable:

* [Caliburn.Micro][1]
* [StructureMap][2]
* [Membus][3]


## Caliburn.Micro:

__What it brings to the table__: 

* Conventional wiring of ViewModel->View, 
* conventional and extendable wiring of UI elements to elements of the Viewmodel, 
* Interfaces that allow you to cleanly describe the lifecycles of your ViewModels, 
* a nice hook to get your favorite DI Container doing instantiation work for you
* A nice attached property to get out of corner cases when needing View events in ViewModels.

__What it should bring to the table__: Not much really, I prefer that thing to stay low-profile.

__What it shouldn't bring to the table__: I can't find a use case for the coroutine implementation, I don't need the event aggregator (see MemBus), it's unlikely I'll ever need all those default conductors already defined.

## StructureMap

__What it brings to the table__: Fufils all instantiation needs you'll ever have, served to you in a non-ceremomial way that puts the current MEF incarnation to shame.

__What it should bring to the table__: Some funky things I am beginning to desire after a couple of years of DI Container usage.

## MemBus

__What it brings to the table__: Fulfils all "event aggregation" needs you'll ever have. Seamless wiring of ViewModels to messages, in-built mechsnism to ensure messages are processed on the UI thread or processed in the background, extensible to allow your own interesting scenarios around app-internal messaging.

__What it should bring to the table__: I am still wondering whether correlated messaging could be useful (publishing a message with id x and then receiving messages in the context of that id)

__What it doesn't need to bring to the table__: Funny enough there is quite a bit of API I don't need anymore, because it can be expressed in a different way that seems more attractive and maintainable. I'll probably mark those bits as obsolete.

This _package_, sprinkled with a number of goodies which I usually don't bother making a dll of (for example the [DataTemplateChoice][4], or an attached property to influence Focus from the ViewModel, or a key binding service with a simple API that saves me the trouble to know the goddamn visual tree all the time) allows for a pretty quick development speed while maintaining a fairly clean overall structure and keeping a number of hooks and tools around to tackle more challenging stuff.
