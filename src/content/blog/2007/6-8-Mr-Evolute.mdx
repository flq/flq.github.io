<Alpha>Can you remember that sad time when some people suddenly thought that it's desperately necessary that God made Earth in a couple of thousand years?</Alpha>

<Beta>You mean that intelligent creator business?</Beta>

<Alpha>Yeah...</Alpha>

<Beta>Well, do you remember how that weird group, how did they call themselves...</Beta>

<Alpha>The creationists</Alpha>

<Beta>Yeah, those.</Beta>

<Alpha>That was pretty amazing. Did they actually manage the reality hack they intended to do?</Alpha>

<Beta>You don't kow? Rumour has it that they failed miserably. There was no indication that they actually created the species on Earth.</Beta>

<Alpha>Quite. Considering that it's an ongoing, constant creation, they would still have to be around...</Alpha>

<Beta>Well, unless they created a self-sustained reality hack.</Beta>

<Alpha>You mean, they could have implemented evolution?</Alpha>

<Beta>Hmm...interesting. However, that would probably prove that the Evoluzzers did not implement Evolution. Evolution is far more intelligent than any human being.</Beta>

<Alpha>An Intelligent creator after all?</Alpha>

<Beta>Not at all, my dear hesitant friend. The question is, what is intelligence anyway?</Beta>

<Alpha>Let me check on the wicked pedia. Right. There is a ton of definitions, really.</Alpha>

Here ends this dialogue...who knows what happened? 
The argument was finalized in a ["normal" post](/2008/02/25/evolutions-intelligence) sometime later.
