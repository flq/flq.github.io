The resulting type<sup>*)</sup> imbalance is however constrained to the physical geometry of the Multi-resonance crystals. It means that the resulting unhinged state of the MRC is not measurable as such from the outside. For any repeatedly used particle resonance<sup>**)</sup>  a saturation point is reached after which the given resonance (e.g. electron and proton to photon) cannot be sustained any longer. After this point the crystal’s reactions are notoriously difficult to predict. The MRC begins to interact with its surroundings and can do so on any level of fundamental forces. Under certain conditions it can even exert a field of strong nuclear force on its surroundings. This is the reason why almost all applications of the MRC are based on its reactions in a non-saturated state.

Just to avoid misunderstandings, the following diagram attempts to put the most important parameters concerning the described system into relation. Please bear in mind that most of those parameters are spanned by an n-dimensional solution domain and that not all relevant parameters are included, especially not when considering the MRC properties when being used beyond the type saturation point.

You can imagine that whole books can be written about MRCs, with them being the foundation of Iilasian technology. Even now, 32’637 Ii-Years   (roughly 26 and a half human millenia) after the DAUGHTER’s departure from the dying sun Yhsuu, improvements are still achieved in usage and yield of MRCs. Operating the crystals within the specifications required by Iilasian technology signifies a constant degradation of the Crystal’s useful properties. Furthermore the so called fully balanced crystal is only a mathematical ideal since no crystal that can be found in the orbit of a pulsar is perfectly balanced. Said crystals are being arbitrarily bombarded with all kinds of particles. Indeed, the lifespan of such crystals in the vicinity of neutron stars is limited to a few weeks, months at best, depending on the characteristics of the neutron star. While most particles will simply pass through the crystal unchanged, some combinations of the bombardment will result in a resonance and generate a corresponding particle stream, thus resulting in the crystal becoming type-imbalanced. This degradation can also be described as the degradation from a pure crystal to an impure one.

Improvements are being made in pushing up the limit of impurity level that causes the MRC to become useless. Great improvements have been made in reducing the rate of degradation of the crystals in use. One of the prides of the Iilasian swarm are the two purification ships that are currently in service. They are the first of their kind bearing the necessary plants to interact with MRCs beyond their type saturation limits. Those types of interactions enable the reduction of the crystal’s impurity.

All this, however would not have been possible if a deeper understanding of what goes on in a MRC had not been found. Entering the crystal, typed matter (i.e. matter having a definition in the Spacetime dimensions as well as bearing the necessary properties to take part in 4Band causality) becomes separated into its Spacetime component (thereby forming untyped matter) and the properties that turn a Spacetime energy peak e.g. into an electron. In Iilasian science, those properties can also be expressed as entities as much as electrons are and thus form part in the interactions that shape reality. A crucial difference though is that an entity like ‘charge’ has a far greater interaction frequency than an electron has. Even this statement is ultimately misleading – Even so, the property of charge can exist without being involved in 4Band-based causality. Charge, Charm or Strangeness are universal properties like Spacetime itself. From our 4Band based perspective, these properties are potentials most of their time but they are not, they are quite real and their greater interaction frequencies are the cornerstones that span our commonly known Spacetime interactions.

Those cornerstones, however, are within the focus of the causal interactions occurring inside a MRC. It’s not terribly easy to describe this in words, but when a particle enters the MRC it becomes blurred, much more than it actually is. Indeed, although it does not fully describe the situation, a first approximation with classical quantum mechanics must assume a greater Planck constant inside the Multi-resonance crystal. Again, this is just a first approximation because classical physics does not tell us much of the interaction between Spacetime and important quantum constants. Based on Iilasian science it was found out that the idea of a single electron crossing through Spacetime is mostly given up in favour of interaction with entities of equal or greater interaction frequency, which invariably leads to a great blurriness in the spatial definition of the electron – All this within the confines of the MRC. As much as electrons interact with each other via photons to change their definition within the context of Spacetime, Entities can interact with each other outside those boundaries. This interaction is facilitated within an MRC. 

Its relative independency from spatial coordinates means that any particle entering the MRC can interact with any other particle that is also inside at a given time. Even in a MRC the resulting interaction frequencies and the related entities are what counts, meaning that a resonance situation must arise between the different particles. This is not always the case and the figure on the previous page addresses the necessary parameters that need to be considered. 
Those resonances happen at interaction frequencies equal to or greater than the ones on which the 4Band interactions run.

## *)

As a reminder - type denotes any actual parameter required by untyped matter for interaction with the 4Band-based kinetic model. An electron is a 4Band particle with spin, electrical charge, a given 4Band interaction frequency and a spatial representation with its derived scalars and vectors.

## **)

Resonance in the sense of fundamental particle interaction. Spoken in images, by describing the particle’s properties as a complex wave function, models are available that describe its propagation inside the MRC. Due to this very special propagation, resonance effects occur with other particles when they are streamed into the MRC.
