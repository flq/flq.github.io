A tss entry caught my curiosity as it was talking about a "[generics puzzle](http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2007/01/25/java-generics-puzzler/)" in JAVA. Finally, I thought, an example-based look at how JAVA generics differ from their .NET pendant? Indeed, the puzzle turns out to not be one in e.g. C#.

If the intent is to be able to create instances of a provided type argument, we need a constrain on the provided type argument to provide a parameterless constructor... 

```csharp
class GenericCheck<T> where T : new() {
  public T Instance {
    get {
      return Activator.CreateInstance<T>();
    }
  }
}
```

Beware, though that if T has no default constructor, construction will fail with a MissingMethodException. Funny enough though, the Activator's method has no constraint on T, which it could easily implement:

```csharp
public V CreateInstance<V>() where V : new() ...
```

Apart from that you could also construct types that have no default constructor. Just sprinkle in some reflection. The type in question is easily accessed with typeof(T)...

```csharp
class GenericCheck<T> {

  public T Instance(string name, int age) {
      Type t = typeof(T);
      ConstructorInfo info = t.GetConstructor(
          new Type[] { typeof(string), typeof(int) });
      if (info != null) {
        return (T)info.Invoke(BindingFlags.CreateInstance,
            null,new object[] { name, age },null);
      }
      return default(T);
  }

}

public static void Test() {
  GenericCheck<Person> gp = new GenericCheck<Person>();
  Person p = gp.Instance("martha", 24);
}
```

What you don't get with this approach is type safety, and you'll probably have a performance penalty, but that's another subject.
So, no puzzles to be seen...
