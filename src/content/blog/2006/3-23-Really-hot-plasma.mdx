[Sandiaâ€™s Z machine exceeds two billion degrees Kelvin](http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2006/physics-astron/hottest-z-output.html) : I would like to know how you actually measure such a temperature, but I love the idea that some extra kinetic turbulence gets the stuff verrry hot. As they say, fun is not a straight line.
