A really nice animation attempting to dissect the century-old wonderings of whether subatomic particles are more like waves or more like..er..particles. Well, the question is just as amazing as watching you from the front and then from the back and then wondering how all of this could be you. So: Yawn, but nice nonetheless. The involvement of whatthebleep ensures a good quality of explanation and CGI.
