[Emilie du Châtelet](http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianweekly/story/0,,1835656,00.html) - the scientist whom history forgot - A woman that in her emancipation was well beyond her time and whose intelligence must have scared most of them away. Apparently she was fairly important to physics, yet it&#39;s a name you do not come across very often.
