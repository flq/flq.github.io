Remember the blog entries [Quantum computer solves problem...][1] and [How to find some bombs...][2] ? Well, they are related, since 'counterfactual computing' is related to 'interaction-free measurement'.

The last physics entry then referred to a paper [Quantum to Classical Transition...](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605105) that tries to explain interaction-free measurement based on a RBW point of view.

This new paper, [The limits of counterfactual computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606092) then relates again to the first link presented.

It's all a web of relations...
