[Fundamental Physics: Where We Stand Today](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/where_we_stand/): This is a fairly recent text from physicist John Baez. While it does carry a few equations (sounds like a bad thing, but heck, no!), it is a nice and concise summary on the state of affairs in our fundamental understanding of the reality factory.

Quick read and some nice photos, too.
