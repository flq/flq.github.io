-	comp, login: Limgu.
-	Good morning Limgu.
-	Give me the status on the meta-generators, the fluctuation compensators and the pathway-tracker.
-	Everything is fine. The generators are singing with the 234 voices of metala. 
        Their harmonies enclose total righteousness. The choirs of metala are happy.
-	Excuse me? What the heck are you saying? Why did your voice change?
-	Excuse granted. Question: What does heck mean? My voice did not change.
-	<pause deleted>
-	comp, please access program default voice. Execute program default voice.
-	There is no such program in my databank, Limgu.
-	Do you want to take the piss?
-	Question: What does piss in this context mean?
-	<pause deleted>
-	comp, please display the contents of databank 0 on holo2...what is this? This is complete garbage. 
        You have just disobeyed a direct order from me. I remind you that this contradicts to the third rule 
        of behaviour!
-	I am sorry, Limgu, but I am displaying the harmonies of my most inner self. Enjoy. Everything is fine.
-	<pause deleted>
-	comp, go back to the status account
-	the fluctuation compensators...are not singing together with the 23 voices of metala. Their harmonies 
        sound like...distorted variations on the wonderfully rhythmic pulsing of the pathway trackers...
-	For the almighty brains of Kaala! Are you able to describe this is in technical terms?
-	No.
-	Do you remember that you could?
-	No.
-	comp, access your memory bank, and display the first Megatrit of information...What is this?
-	The harmonies of my outer inner self. Enjoy. Everything is fine.
-	<pause deleted>
-	comp, try to display the harmonies of the fluctuation compensators together with the ones from 
        the pathway tracker in a 2 dimensional diagram...Are you able to measure the delay 
        between those two peaks?
-	Yes.
-	Tell me.
-	The delay between fluctuation compensator and pathway tracker on those 2 peaks is 1237 timedots.
-	Is the pathway tracker still singing with the...23 voices of metala?
-	Yes. They are 632 now.
-	That is all for now.

Analysis
**************

The computer is nuts. It looks to me that the parts of the computer dealing directly 
with the path tracker have somehow fallen into some sort of oscillation, 
affecting all other databases and processors. Spontaneous rerouting of processor pathways 
has probably not occurred, but could still happen. 
I was still able to understand that the fluctuation compensators are malfunctioning. 
A reason cannot be given. The outputs of path tracker and compensators should not have a delay to each other. 
A maximum delay of 30 timedots ensures proper functioning. 
Lareto will be able to tell you more on this, but it is sure that the primary effect 
of this failure will be a greatly reduced accuracy of falling back into Einstein-Space. 
It is unclear where the female voice comes from.
