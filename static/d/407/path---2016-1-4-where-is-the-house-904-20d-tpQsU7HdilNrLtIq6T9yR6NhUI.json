On OSX it is a good thing if you've got <strong>brew</strong> such that you can do <code>brew install mono</code>.\nThis will also bring F# onto the system, which should then be available on the path (and to the plugin). Bear in mind that the main executables are called slightly different to their Windows counterparts. You get</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fsi -> fsharpi</li>\n<li>fsc -> fsharpc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have npm on your system it is also very nice that there is a project generator (<em>fsharp-project</em>) available under <a href=\"http://yeoman.io\">yeoman</a> - it can generate you the basic structure of your project with all the goodies that the F# community has come up with, things like FAKE and Paket..</p>\n<p>The code created will be available in <a href=\"https://github.com/flq/ionized-z-machine\">runnable form on github</a>, and I will introduce a tag after every post in case anybody cares to go back to a specific commit associated with a blog post.</p>\n<p>Coming to Eric's <a href=\"http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/03/north-of-house/#more-3446\">second post</a>, the method to get the top bits of a 16-bit word looks...very similar, just that\nin F# we have operators that look a bit like their C-style counterparts.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-fsharp\">let fetch_bits high length word =\n  let mask = ~~~ (-1 &#x3C;&#x3C;&#x3C; length) in\n  (word >>> (high - length + 1)) &#x26;&#x26;&#x26; mask\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 04, 2016","path":null,"title":"Where is the house","tags":["fsharp","ionz"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Where is the house"}}
