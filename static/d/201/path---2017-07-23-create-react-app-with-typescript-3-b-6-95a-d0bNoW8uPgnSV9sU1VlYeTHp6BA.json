Io and behold, the analog to create-react-app for typescript can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript\">here</a> and is used as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> -g create-react-app\ncreate-react-app my-app --scripts-version<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>react-scripts-ts</code></pre></div>\n<p>This essentially gives you the same starting point as the standard <strong>create-react-app</strong>, but with Typescript.</p>\n<p>This often means that you will require type definitions to properly work with libraries. That is, e.g. to introduce enzyme for testing we would then do:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer react-dom enzyme chai @types/enzyme @types/chai</code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I usually don't get VS Code refreshed when downloading types.\nA quick restart of the app helps me out. Not sure if it is normal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Something that you may come to appreciate to push down the number of open tabs in the browser is the auto-completion that is now available to you...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/cra-ts-autocomplete.png\" alt=\"ts auto-complete\"></p>\n<p>So, we're off to a good start and we may finally be able to leave the realm of hello'ing each other until boredom kicks in and destroys our brain cells.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 23, 2017","path":null,"title":"Create react app with typescript","tags":["programming","web","typescript","react"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Create react app with typescript"}}
