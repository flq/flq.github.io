It recommends to set up <a href=\"http://www.stackage.org\">stackage</a> for your system, which apparently is a safer version of hackage, the place where haskell packages live. Safe here means less likelihood of versioning issues i your package dependency chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And frankly, you can pretty much follow the quickstart guide word by word, there has been no apparent difference to setting this up on a Linux box.</p>\n<p>While I was at it, I decided to install <a href=\"https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell\">SublimeHaskell</a> - For an optimal feature set it wants you to install a couple of Haskell packages.
