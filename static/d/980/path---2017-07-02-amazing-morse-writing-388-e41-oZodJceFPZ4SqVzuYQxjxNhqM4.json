{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A week ago the public was allowed onto Freiburg's airfield, to see\nwhat people around aviation are up to. There were also a few people\nshowing off their morse code sending skills - I got fairly impressed,\nbecause the one sending morse code wasn't actually transmitting each sign on its own with a switch i.e. pressing <em>long-short-long-long</em>, etc. but rather they put the switch to one position which emits a constant stream of shorts and then the other position emits a constant stream of longs. The advantages seem to be that you can set the <strong>\"bpm\"</strong> of your conversation to some fixed number determined by the skill of the people involved in the dialogue and you need to move your fingers a lot less since you only ever use the switch when there is a change between <strong>\"long\"</strong> and <strong>\"short\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>Take this <strong>\"hello world\"</strong> as an example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/hello-world-morse.JPG\"></p>\n<p>What I found quite crazy is that when you are using that kind of switch to transmit morse code, the boundaries where you have to change the switch do not overlap with word or even letter boundaries. I don't know about you, but I found that pretty impressive and is yet another example for the incredible plasticity of our brain!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 02, 2017","path":null,"title":"Amazing morse writing","tags":["loosely-coupled"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Amazing morse writing","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/06/25/separating-ms-bots-soul-from-its-body"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Separating MS Bot's soul from its body","tags":["dotnet","programming","software-development","cloud"],"date":"2017/06/25"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/07/05/so-you-need-a-websocket-server-like-now"},"frontmatter":{"title":"So you need a websocket server, like, now","tags":["programming","web"],"date":"2017/07/05"}}}}
