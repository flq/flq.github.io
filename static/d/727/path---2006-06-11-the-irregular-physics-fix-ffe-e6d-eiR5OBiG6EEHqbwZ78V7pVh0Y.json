I for my part would think that with change being a predominant feature of our reality, if only to figure out where exactly we should place ourselves in that relational blockworld of ours, something like a constant is not what you'd expect it to be. Either way, just alone for the last statement of that blog entry it is worthwhile linking, as it states that ...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, we should welcome all new knowledge even if it does not agree with our present conception of the world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you were wondering what relational blockworld is, here some links that may help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605039\">An Argument for 4D Blockworld from a Geometric Interpretation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics</a> - I have read through this one and it was quite interesting.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605105\">Quantum to Classical Transition per the Relational Blockworld</a> - Written by the same authors, I haven't read this one yet, but it will be a read consistent with the previous one</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And while this here sounds quite different to RBW, I have the suspicion that there are similarities as both accounts see more in empty space than physics has done so far: <a href=\"http://www.quantumaetherdynamics.com/\">Quantum AetherDynamics Institute</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 11, 2006","path":null,"title":"The irregular physics fix","tags":["physics"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"The irregular physics fix"}}
