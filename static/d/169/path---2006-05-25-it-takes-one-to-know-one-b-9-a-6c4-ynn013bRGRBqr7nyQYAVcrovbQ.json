{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Have you ever thought on which energy level you are?</p>\n<p>Hmmm, sure. When I am with my girl I am definitely on a higher energy          level compared to when I start churning quintadimensional equations with          my Gigamac Monday morning.</p>\n<p>Well, I mean on a more philosophical level, more like the principle of          it.</p>\n<p>Ah, you are on to another clash of useless thoughts?</p>\n<p>Listen, man. Imagine you are completely alone...</p>\n<p>Like last Sunday, when the comm-systems were crashed by the infamous '<em>isolate          thyself</em>' Trojan Virus for 2 minutes?</p>\n<p>No, I mean <em>really</em> alone. Totally, the only thing there is, nothing          else, just you and the personification of nothing.</p>\n<p>Hmm. Very abstract. What are you on about?</p>\n<p>I mean, Imagine that. Imagine there is something that sits there, not          even sits, is there, with nothing else. What about its energy level?</p>\n<p>Well, I mean, really nothing around it? It's energy level. Now...if it's          really just that one it..err..don't know.</p>\n<p>Exactly. No energy level, nothing. Really nothing, Because there is nothing          to compare against.</p>\n<p>Which is why I felt so crap last Sunday.</p>\n<p>You are a comm junky...</p>\n<p>I need my energy levels, man.</p>\n<p>But you see, a...universe...let's call it universe, with only <em>one</em>          element in it, has no energy levels. And energy levels are the driving          force behind anything around us. A universe with one element in it is          pointless.</p>\n<p>Fair point, but talking of universes, you are talking about a frame of          reference. And with a frame of reference you are talking a defined state          of your hypothetical particle that must feel rather sad.</p>\n<p>You are being too literal. But you are right. Forget the universe around          it, it would be an outside reference. I mean, set this aside, with one          element, you could set the frame of reference anywhere, it is totally          meaningless. The particle might move, or not. Meaningless.</p>\n<p>Rotate?</p>\n<p>Meaningless</p>\n<p>Inflate, deflate?</p>\n<p>Fairly meaningless</p>\n<p>Geez, you are being boring, aren't you?</p>\n<p>My point is, you need at least <em>two</em> to have fun. You need one to          know one.</p>\n<p>I think I would agree. And my girlfriend, too.</p>\n<p>You sure? The other week she didn't seem to happy about your presence...</p>\n<p>Wasn't my fault someone had mixed some Oom into my drink. God, those reality          hacks are getting quite annoying...</p>\n<p>Anyway, two elements, what now?</p>\n<p>Well, if one now moves, it means something, 'cos you can measure it. And          if one rotates, it means something, 'cos one looses sight of the other.</p>\n<p>Something along those lines...although rotation will not be measurable          without non-symmetrical parameters that relate to an axis of revolution.          Anyway...what I always found tough is; Why the heck do the two know of          each other?</p>\n<p>Hey, you remember how I met my girl?</p>\n<p>Oh, cut it, I have heard it a thousand times...</p>\n<p>Well, but maybe it means something? Maybe there must be a <em>third</em>          party involved?</p>\n<p>A third party? How do you mean?</p>\n<p>Well, you know, something that makes the two aware of each other?</p>\n<p>And then what? Then they remember by themselves after the aquaintance?          Or the third party remembers everything, where the two particles were,          where they are, where they will be?</p>\n<p>You are getting time into this again...</p>\n<p>Makes it easier to think about the shit. You see, if you get a third party          into this, you reduce the two particles to mere shadows of something that          is essentially already defined...</p>\n<p>And your freedom loving, knowledge-thirsty mind really has a problem with          that, I suppose.</p>\n<p>Exactly. We just agreed that we essentially need two to have fun. A third          party really breaks the idea.</p>\n<p>Yeah. <em>Menage-Ã -trois</em> is the shittiest thing that can happen.</p>\n<p>Agreed. So, what do we do?</p>\n<p>Hmmm. Let's keep the third party in it. As an imaginary space. As a line,          with the two particles being their end-points. Nothing else. What do we          have now?</p>\n<p>Fairly simplistic, isn't it?</p>\n<p>Hey, you wanted to get rid of the third party. But you see, it isn't a          problem anymore, your 'Geez, how do they know of each other' - thing.          The only way that the two particles can somehow...interact...</p>\n<p>Why, thank you, I have been waiting for that word!</p>\n<p>...shut up. Well, the only way is along the line. Either they use it,          or they don't. Actually, the mere existence of that line requires the          two particles to have formed it. Or, and that is really cool, the only          measurable parameter we have defined so far is the length of that damned          line. You see, <em>two</em> particles result in <em>one</em> measurable parameter.</p>\n<p>Right...nice. Cute. No, really. Has your girl-friend told you that?</p>\n<p>You think a lot of her, don't you? You want to borrow her? For your discussions,          I mean?</p>\n<p>Get a job on the moon! You are so mad, Jesus. Well, still, I think it's          a cute thought. Anyway, now the two particles know of each other. Well,          the fact that they share that..room makes them pretty knowledgeable particles.          But, you see, the only frame those two particles have is that line, which          really means that their positions are really meaningless. ..I mean, the          only thing that is really described is the length of that line.</p>\n<p>Well, as I said; Euclid would really be proud of you. The shortest connection          between two distinct points is a line. Well done. A shot of <em>Oom</em>          wouldn't have brought out a deeper understanding of life.</p>\n<p>Has someone ever told you that you suck more than the <em>UltraDomino</em>          Virus? A line of finite length implies two points. Any sensible description          of a parameter requires two distinct elements. Remember that. It is important.</p>\n<p>Yeah...I will think of it the next time my chica is trying to kill me.          I will tell her: 'Babe, if you kill me, your existence will become meaningless          the very second you do it!'</p>\n<p>Yeah...her energy level would become undefined.</p>\n<p>Right so. That should teach her.\n</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/05/25/it-takes-one-to-know-one"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 25, 2006","path":null,"title":"It takes one to know one","tags":["hesitan-and-miracles"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"It takes one to know one","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/05/25/the-ant-and-the-green-eyed-bug"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Ant and the Green Eyed Bug","tags":["hesitan-and-miracles"],"date":"2006/05/25"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/05/25/oh-brother-whats-art-though"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Oh Brother, What's Art though?","tags":["hesitan-and-miracles"],"date":"2006/05/25"}}}}
