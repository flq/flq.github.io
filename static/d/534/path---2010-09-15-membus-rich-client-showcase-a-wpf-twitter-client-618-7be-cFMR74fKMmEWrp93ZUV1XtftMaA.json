{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After pondering a bit about the example application that should showcase MemBus, I thought that it should be a Twitter client. I think that Twitter Clients are something like the web eraâ€™s Hello World examples.</p>\n<p>The example application is found under the MemBus directory at github: <a href=\"http://github.com/flq/MemBus/tree/master/Membus.WpfTwitterClient/\">http://github.com/flq/MemBus/tree/master/Membus.WpfTwitterClient/</a></p>\n<p>It will use MemBus, a DI container and a WPF framework to show off message-based patterns. Functionality-wise it will be a Twitter Client that will allow you to post status updates and see your timeline.</p>\n <div class=\"alert\"> \n<p><strong>Nag</strong></p>\n<p>Since this Client is open source there is the problem that distributing the necessary secrets to access the Twitter API would be just too obvious. In this <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c18ade9d86c8b239?pli=1\">discussion thread here</a> a strategy is proposed how to solve that issue. For now, I am afraid that I cannot distribute the secrets. Stay tuned for a better solution.</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 15, 2010","path":null,"title":"MemBus Rich Client showcase: A WPF Twitter Client","tags":["software-development","dotnet","membus"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"MemBus Rich Client showcase: A WPF Twitter Client","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/15/using-membus"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using MemBus","tags":["patterns","csharp","membus"],"date":"2010/09/15"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/20/membus-extension-points"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MemBus extension points","tags":["own-software","patterns","csharp","membus"],"date":"2010/09/20"}}}}
