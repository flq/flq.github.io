{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>What Andre's link <a href=\"/go/92\">caused</a>...</p>\n<p>One idea that came up from a former colleague of mine, Christoph was to rebase the number PI to 27, allowing for a presentation in the form of letters of the alphabet. His first tackle at this was written in ruby:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">pi = 14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097\n494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798214808651328230\n664709384460955058223172535940812848111745028410270193852110\n555964462294895493038196442881097566593344612847564823378678\n316527120190914564856692346034861045432664821339360726024914\n127372458700660631558817488152092096282925409171536436789259\n0360011330530548820466521384146951941511609\nalphabeth = []\n\"a\".upto(\"z\") { |x| alphabeth &#x3C;&#x3C; x}\nbase = alphabeth.length\ntext = []\n\nbegin\n  pi, rest = pi.divmod(base)\n  text &#x3C;&#x3C; alphabeth[rest]\nend until pi.zero?\nputs text.reverse.join\n</code></pre>\n<p>A nice way to express what is also presented <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal#Converting_from_other_bases\">here at wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<p>After doing some research as to how I could rebase arbitrarily large numbers, my search was suddenly halted by a uber-geek page. Once more I had to accept that whatever silly way to waste your time you come up with, someone has done it before you, and even added some icing to the cake. May I present to you <a href=\"http://ww%0Aw.dr-mikes-maths.com/pisearch.html\">Dr. Mike's Math</a>, where you can search for arbitrary strings within the first 31,415,929 digits of Π. That's a good start, I'd say! This is so geeky, I would think it is correct.</p></p>\n<p>Consequently, this case is closed. Really.
