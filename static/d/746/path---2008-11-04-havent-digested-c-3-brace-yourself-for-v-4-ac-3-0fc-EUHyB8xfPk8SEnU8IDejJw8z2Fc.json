Many months ago we were already allowed to peek at Hejlsberg &#x26; Team sitting in an old meeting room, talking about what C# 4.0 would be all about (I have lost the link but you <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/\">here's</a> his talk at the PDC about the upcoming language - Takes some time, but it's pretty good).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: You MUST watch at least the last 10 minutes. That stuff apparently won't enter the C#4.0 but \"Compiler as a Service\" is pretty close to magic.</p>\n<p>Major keywords were: Concurrency, 'Declarativeness', Dynamic Features.</p>\n<p>Just now, posts are coming up highlighting information available on new language features - a good moment for me to gather some links...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The dynamic keyword:</p>\n<p>For an interesting example introducing the dynamic Keyword, making an XMLNode behave like an instance with properties, <a href=\"http://mark.michaelis.net/Blog/DynamicallyTypedObjectsWithC40.aspx\">go here</a>. Such stuff may allow to do duck typing: Some sort of ad-hoc bolting on of an interface.

At some point such things may appear in the language...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional parameters and named parameters become part of the language.

Some of this stuff is content that I have been waiting for. I have cursed the invariance of generic types a number of times, and I have been waiting for the marriage of CLR + DLR a long time to get some personal project of mine going. I have never really missed optional and named parameters, but guess that people having to do a lot of COM interop will just love it.\nAs a trainer in introduction to .NET with C#, however, this is an utter catastrophe. An introductionary course will now quite easily fill roughly 6-7 days!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2008/11/04/havent-digested-c-3-brace-yourself-for-v4"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 04, 2008","path":null,"title":"Haven't digested C#3?
