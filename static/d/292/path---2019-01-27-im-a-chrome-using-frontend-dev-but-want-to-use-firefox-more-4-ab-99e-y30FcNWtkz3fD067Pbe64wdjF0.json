{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>You like to use Chrome, and you value the in-built development aids. However, you feel increasingly uneasy about the market dominance of Chrome as the portal to the web. You'd like to give Firefox a chance, but are uncertain if some general and dev-related features will be available on Firefox. This list is geared towards the team I'm working in, but maybe others will find it useful, too.</p>\n<h4>I sync stuff across a plentitude of devices</h4>\n<p>Firefox has <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/\">a syncing service</a>. I use it to sync, my home and work laptop alongside my phone and iPad. According to this, the people at Firefox <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/\">only ever see your data encrypted</a>.</p>\n<h4>I still search through Google, what the heck!</h4>\n<p>Yes it's true, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-firefox-search-deal-gives-mozilla-more-money-to-push-privacy/\">Mozilla gets money from Google</a> since they do generate search traffic towards them. At least, it's pretty easy to switch the default search engine (<strong>about:preferences#search</strong>).</p>\n<h4>When I develop, I impersonate a number of accounts. On Chrome I use profiles for that. What do I do in Firefox?</h4>\n<p>Firefox has a profiles feature, too!</p>\n<p>The easiest is to enter <strong>about:profiles</strong> in the url input ( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> ).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/about_profiles.png\" alt=\"firefox location bar\"></p>\n<p>Here you can manage profiles you define, and, most importantly, let several ones run in parallel. You can also start firefox in a specific profile with <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and then <code class=\"language-text\">firefox.exe -P profilename</code>. Unfortunately this only works if Firefox is not running. If you want several parallel sessions, you'll go through the location bar as described.</p>\n<h4>What about devtools?</h4>\n<p>Firefox has <em>plenty</em> of devtools that also come up with <kbd>F12</kbd>, here just quickly those that we use a lot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mobile view can be switched on the very right\n<img src=\"/assets/firefox-mobileview.png\" alt=\"firefox location bar\"></li>\n<li>Modify css and layout, look at the computed fields (also mapped down to the causing source code if map files are present)</li>\n<li>Sources are found under <em>Debugger</em>, with map files, also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to locate a file.</li>\n<li>The <em>network analysis</em> tab allows you to toggle the cache and throttle the network. For some crazy reason <strong>you cannot turn off the network</strong>, only very clumsily by going into offline mode, which affects the whol browser session. Looking for a good solution here!</li>\n<li>React and Redux devtools are also available and look and behave pretty much the same way as in Chrome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Give it a shot. If anything, you can have Chrome and Firefox in parallel, who knows, you might even like the new Firefox!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/01/27/im-a-chrome-using-frontend-dev-but-want-to-use-firefox-more"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 27, 2019","path":null,"title":"I'm a Chrome-using frontend dev, but want to use Firefox more","tags":["web","programming"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"I'm a Chrome-using frontend dev, but want to use Firefox more","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/01/13/stuff-we-like-great-chocolate"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stuff we like: Great Chocolate!","tags":["stuff-we-like"],"date":"2019/01/13"}},"next":null}}
