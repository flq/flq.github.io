{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Today I saw an <a href=\"http://www.prosieben.de/wissen/galileomystery/episoden/artikel/45913/\">interesting show</a> about the capabilities of human fighters skilled in their respective arts like boxing, Karate or Nin Jitsu. </p>\n<p>One of the shown challenges was a test of reaction time. Here one of the fighters apparently managed to react consistently to a stimulus in about 0.18 secs. The Internet is full of games with which you can test your reaction. Here's a small selection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sleep/sheep/reaction_version5.swf\">Sending sheep to sleep</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cognitivelabs.com/Brainpal_test_yellow.htm\">React when the dot's colour changes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gamehump.com/games/Madness-Reaction-Time\">Dodge the bullet until you can't</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the game sometimes I manage to scratch the 0.18 mark, but usually I lie in the region of 0.2-0.3 seconds in reaction. Not bad you may say (However, my wife tends to be a tad quicker than me. Alas, she doesn't want to learn how to play Half-Life. A waste of talent, I'd like to say...). </p>\n<p>Even so, the test in the TV show involved reacting to four lights placed like the extremities of a human body. The fighter then had to kick just the place where the light showed. Considering that this involves a lot more hard wiring in the brain I find a reaction time below .2 secs rather impressive!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/01/human-reaction-time"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 30, 2007","path":null,"title":"Human Reaction Time","tags":["biology"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Human Reaction Time","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/11/19/vs-2008-net-3-5-shipped","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"VS 2008, .NET 3.5 shipped","tags":["software-development","dotnet"],"date":"2007/11/19"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/12/02/where-gaming-is-what-it-is","published":true},"frontmatter":{"title":"Where Gaming is what it is","tags":["geekdom"],"date":"2007/12/01"}}}}
