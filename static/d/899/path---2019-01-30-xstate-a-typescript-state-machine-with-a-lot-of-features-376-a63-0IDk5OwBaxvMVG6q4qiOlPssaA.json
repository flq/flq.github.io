I wanted to recreate the \"tape player\" from my post 12 years ago. COnsidering that xstate brings a lot more to the plate, I wanted the tape player to be a lot more complete than back then. The <a href=\"https://github.com/flq/test-of-xstate\">source code</a> for the final result runs as react app and can be found under my github profile.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://statecharts.github.io/xstate-viz/\">statecharts.github.io</a> it is possible to visualize the state machine that you defined. For the tape player in the source code we get this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xstate_visual.png\" alt=\"firefox location bar\"></p>\n<p>And you thought a tape player is easy? What you see is the states (the big boxes) and events (the small labels that start arrows) that your machine defines.</p>\n<p>The tape player is initially <strong>stopped</strong>. </p>\n<p>The state machine definition is one configuration object where you describe transitions, effects and conditions that govern your state machine.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/01/30/xstate-a-typescript-state-machine-with-a-lot-of-features"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 30, 2019","path":null,"title":"XState - a Typescript state machine with a lot of features","tags":["typescript","programming"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"XState - a Typescript state machine with a lot of features","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/01/27/im-a-chrome-using-frontend-dev-but-want-to-use-firefox-more"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I'm a Chrome-using frontend dev, but want to use Firefox more","tags":["web","programming"],"date":"2019/01/27"}},"next":null}}
