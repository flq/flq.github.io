Bail-out here is to define a <strong>HOME</strong> variable and let it point to e.g. %USERPROFILE%</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 06, 2010","path":null,"title":"Getting FubuMVC from github and building it from the command line","tags":["ruby","dotnet","web","libs-and-frameworks"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Getting FubuMVC from github and building it from the command line"}}
