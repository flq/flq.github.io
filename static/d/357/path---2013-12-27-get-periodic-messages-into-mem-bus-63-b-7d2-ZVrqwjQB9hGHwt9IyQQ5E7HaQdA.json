{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In the previous post introducing MemBus v3 I mentioned that I removed a project in the solution that contained code to help setting up the creation of periodic messages - once I probed the Rx-codebase a little more I found that there is support to set up Observables that create output periodically - so here's a (very) short post on how you combine that with MemBus.\nFirst, go forth and make yourself a bus - don't forget to setup the flexible subscribe adapter. The provided lambda returns true for all method candidates (<em>I realize that this screams for an overload</em>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">readonly IBus _bus = BusSetup\n    .StartWith&#x3C;Conservative>()\n    .Apply&#x3C;FlexibleSubscribeAdapter>(cfg => cfg.RegisterMethods(info => true))\n    .Construct();\n</code></pre>\n<p>As an example, let's have a class that provides timers for our application - the example shown sends out a <strong>MessageA</strong> instance 5 times every 100 milliseconds on the <em>Default Scheduler</em> (according to documentation the most appropriate strategy on the targetted system that does not block the current thread).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">private class Timers\n{\n    public IObservable&#x3C;MessageA> ASignal()\n    {\n        return Observable\n        .Timer(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(10), TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(100), Scheduler.Default)\n        .Take(5)\n        .Select(_ => new MessageA());\n    } \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Providing the observable to MemBus is as easy as saying...</p>\n<pre><code>_bus.Subscribe(new Timers());\n</code></pre>\n<p>and obtaining the messages could look like</p>\n<pre><code>using (_bus.Subscribe((MessageA _) => cd.Signal()))\n{\n    // Blabla\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I agree that this hardly merits a post, yet sometimes it's nice to see that something is as easy as eating an oven pizza.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 27, 2013","path":null,"title":"Get periodic messages into MemBus","tags":["software-development","membus"]}}},"pageContext":{"title":"Get periodic messages into MemBus"}}
