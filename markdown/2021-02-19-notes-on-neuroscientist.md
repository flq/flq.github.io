Today, my brother shared two links with me. One is a somewhat sci-fi-ish video based on ideas from a certain [Jacque Fresco][1], the other is an interview with Jacques Fresco himself. Consider this post a train of thought initiated by these videos.

<figcaption>Rich Roll Podcast: Interview with Dr. Andrew Hubermann</figcaption>

This is (for me) super-interesting interview, I can recommend the watch, even though I had to split it over several days, since it is more than 2 hours and packed with information.

This is just me keeping some notes, so I can pick up on this againâ€¦

* If you want to change something, learn something, you need **focus**
* [Acetylcholine][1] - important neurotransmitter that marks neurons involved in a certain behavior for change, which is subsequently acted upon **during sleep**.
* What's the brain interested in? 
  * **Duration** - How long will it take
  * **Path** - WHat is the way through?
  * **Outcome** - What is ultimately gonna happen?
* Urgency is required, a state of alertness! Chemically this is [Norepinephrine][2], Adrenaline
* Alertness and Focus towards a thought, action pattern, behavior - This gives you plasticity
* Desire or love or fear - either works to give you altertness and focus :)
* [Dopamine][3] _"puts us on the right path"_. It is given, when we are on the right path. It is not just about the **outcome**, it is also about the **path**!
  * Norepinephrine is also the "substrate" for quitting, dopamine counteracts that and gives you...the second air :)
  * So, dopamine can give you more room to do duration, path, outcome work.
  * **However**, dopamine also tightens our focus, this can lead to addiction
  * **Addiction** - a progressive narrowing of the things that give you pleasure

You need all the three components for new behaviors / neuroplasticity: Acetylcholine, Norepinephrine, Dopamine

Growth Mindset: Anxiety / Agitation / Frustration is a known gate! Those high levels of Adrenalin are necessary to get into growth. This is the entry point and this must be acknowledged

* Don't suppress thoughts, Introduce new thoughts!
