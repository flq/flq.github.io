 ![Parmenides getting the most out of virtual jourmalism](/assets/parmenides.gif)  A dialogue may, at its best, shed light upon a subject from at least two spots - 
 at worst it could be the senseless mumble of two dim-witted dodderers. 
 The fine Greek tradition of dialectics has shown nonetheless that 2-way communication can progress a chain of thought rather efficiently. 
Hesitan and Miracles, though would be the last to admit that. 

Slightly phased-off and yet always good for an insight, these two strange 
friends share some deep thoughts in a  not too distant future, where humanity 
begins to understand that everything is possible and everything must  be considered with just that premise<span class="clearfix">.</span>
