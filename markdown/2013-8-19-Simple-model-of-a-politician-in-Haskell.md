Here is a simple model of a politician in Haskell, which you can use to create arbitrary politician instances.
You only need to provide that particular politician's body of knowledge and its individual mapping between a statement and a corresponding fallacy. The answering is already implemented.

`gist:6273665#politician.hs`

Please note that the list of fallacies is **very** incomplete and needs expansion. Pull request, anyone? ;)
