Since today is March 14 (or 3/14) hereâ€™s a small Silverlight App showing 3 expansions of Pi. With the slider you can control how many steps of the expansion you want to consider (With the maximum being 50). Equations are taken from [here](http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/30001.1-3.shtml) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_approximations_of_%CF%80). 

<Info>Well, there was some Silverlight code here once - Apparently a xap file. 
It has been lost in the mist of time. You probably wouldn't have a runner, anway :)</Info>

Happy Pi Day!
