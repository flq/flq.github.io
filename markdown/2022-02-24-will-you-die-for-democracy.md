My Dad, born 1937, was of the conviction that people like Nazis only understood one language, the language of power. I believe that this can be generalized to any power which seeks to employ violence to further their ambitions - because they're _convinced_ that they are indeed _superior_ than the defendants.

I think that right after World War 2 there were many people in Europe who were convinced that democratic institutions, and tying together nations into checks & balances, diplomacy were the way forward to avoid such immense bloodshed as the one that took place from 1938 to 45. The **EU** was formed. The **NATO** was formed. The **UN** was formed. Looking from my place in time here, it looks like the political elite, by extension of the highest sovereign in a democratic nation, the populace, was willing to seek better ways to deal with conflicts.

### And boy, did it work!

The world connected, the economies connected, many, many people got wealthy and rich. The world economy, innovation, it all knew only one direction...↗️

I'm fully aware that not everybody on this world shared the same perspective. I am writing from the perspective of a German that was born in 1975

I was able to study in England, met people from all kinds of countries, we learned together and had fun together. In short, life was good.

This was made possible by living in a pluralistic system. By living by the simple assumption that no matter from which backgrounds we come, we could speak to each other and help each other and move things together, within the constraints of the rule of law, of course, to find our luck.

## We forgot what the key to success is

Lately, the feeling I got, though, is that we have forgotten what the key to success is. It is the sharing of values that transcend our activities, values that allow a majority of people to have a share in the growth of a community, a nation. This sharing of values is achieved through **democracy**. 

For me, democracy is the natural extension of our ancestral roots as well as the natural extension of the **fundamental principle of diversity in evolution**. Because a single idea, a monoculture if you will, can be strong in some situation, but perish in another. Embracing diversity is embracing resilience, it really is that simple. 

Also, I think fundamentally, only a democracy is capable to **respect basic human rights**. It certainly doesn't come automatically, but in a country whose power is derived from fear and oppression, respecting human rights is practically unattainable.

## Placing money over values

Unfortunately, in the frenzy of globalization, we forgot a little detail - much of the world isn't democratic. We made business with countries that would routinely violate very basic values. Human rights, slavery, oppression. Countries like Germany, who only a few decades ago had learned what happens when you let a small group of fanatics use and abuse the power of a nation through fear and oppression would do business with what were essentially notorious and corrupt abusers of power. And of course, the people doing business were just meeting other people - in an exchange of goods. And sure, you could not inflict your democratic values to all other nations. After all, the belief, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union was, that our system was superior anyway, and the world would automatically come to terms with it and adopt it. 

**Alas, this approach has failed.**

## Democracy is not a sure-fire success

in-group out-group. democracy must be learned. it is the hardest way to wield power.

then you have people 





China - wealth yes, but at the cost of other groups. A lack of diversity will make you weak.


## When money replaces values

In the past years I often had the feeling that we had crossed peak capitalism. The truth is though that many people have simply become **capitalism extremists**. They are not guided by any values that inform their decision, they are driven by becoming rich. Since capitalism was only ever a tool to let us work together at scale, you suddenly have people that literally worship a hammer - and do not care anymore if the neighbour's house gets built with it or not.

Money was never the key to success. It was the **motivation** to _where_ it should flow. Peak capitalism was a phase where the individual search for wealth and the needs of humanity as a whole did not sufficiently align anymore.
