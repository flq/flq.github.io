## 75 years ago, WW2 ended

Today I was pointed to a famous speech of former President Richard von Weizsäcker he held on the 8th of May 1945 - back then, it was already 40 years ago, that the second world war ended. [The speech][speech] is about 45 minutes long (and in German), but if you're a frequent podcast listener, you can put the speed at 1.5 and listen to the memorable speech in about half an hour.

## Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) vs Dark Matter

I'm really not an expert on this - I haven't studied physics. But since this is my blog, I can give you my personal opinion. I have always favored falvors of MOND over dark matter - that the rotational speeds of galaxies do not correlate with our current theory of gravitation, in the light of visible matter, seemed always more natural an issue with gravitation rather than missing out massive amounts of matter. It seemed that in the time where particle physics completely dominated physics budgets and career ladders in physics, it was a clear case of "What you see is all there is", or, if you know how to wield a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Thankfully, MOND is far from dead and in fact in many circumstances explains observations far easier than dark matter. Susanne, in her typical attitude of thinking for herself, argues that both may be correct and are required to explain all of the observations - which, to me, has a nice symmetry to the basic and fundamental divide between our two most successful physical theories.
