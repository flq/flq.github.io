Eric's [latest post][1] has some more code to chew upon. Here is where we find the first slight deviations in syntax and used modules.

### Generic types

the generic IntMap is defined as such...

    type IntMap<'t> = Map<int,'t>

It looks like F# deviated from the unusual type argument placement in OCaml.

### The bucket

for the `original_bytes` value I actually chose a `byte array`

In `read_bytes` it seemed more idiomatic to me to use `Map.tryFind` which returns an option value on which you can match whether something was found or not:

```fsharp
match Map.tryFind addr bytes.edits with
| (Some value) -> value
| None -> bytes.originalBytes.[addr]
```

### The rest

All other bits stay more or less the same.

As a side note, the byte array that probably uses the .NET type for Array in the background already has an int index. I assume that such a structure is not available in OCaml. In some functional languages finding the element at index x is an O(n) operation in a typical list-like structure, that may also be the case in OCaml.

The code for this post is at [this tag][2].
