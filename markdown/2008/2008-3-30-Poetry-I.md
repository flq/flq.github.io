This is one of my favourite self-made poetry...

> With time fading into insignificance;
> Could life be traversed within a single moment?
> And if this moment is defined by the wink when you looked at me,
> A single pulse of your verve's frequency:
> Could I traverse an infinite number of lifes,
> overwhelmed by the look of your eyes?

btw, and imho [In her shoes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388125/) was a thoughtful movie that had prose (or, let's say, the written word) at the core of the defining events occurring to the main characters. Makes you think that one should read more poetry.
