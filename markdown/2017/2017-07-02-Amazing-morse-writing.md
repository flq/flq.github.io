A week ago the public was allowed onto Freiburg's airfield, to see
what people around aviation are up to. There were also a few people
showing off their morse code sending skills - I got fairly impressed,
because the one sending morse code wasn't actually transmitting each sign on its own with a switch i.e. pressing _long-short-long-long_, etc. but rather they put the switch to one position which emits a constant stream of shorts and then the other position emits a constant stream of longs. The advantages seem to be that you can set the __"bpm"__ of your conversation to some fixed number determined by the skill of the people involved in the dialogue and you need to move your fingers a lot less since you only ever use the switch when there is a change between __"long"__ and __"short"__.

Take this __"hello world"__ as an example:

What I found quite crazy is that when you are using that kind of switch to transmit morse code, the boundaries where you have to change the switch do not overlap with word or even letter boundaries. I don't know about you, but I found that pretty impressive and is yet another example for the incredible plasticity of our brain!
