This image comes up on a regular basis in the interwebs, and I wanted to keep it on my blog, because to me it carries a lot of truth. Simplified, sure, but it shows the most powerful tool the powerful have to protect their oftentimes ill-deserved riches. Framing the discussion. The worst we can do is to accept such framings without asking where they came from.
